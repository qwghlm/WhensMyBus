When's My Bus/Tube/DLR installation instructions

Requirements:

Python 2.6 or greater to run the bot. Python 2.7 required for unit testing. Not yet tested with Python 3

Also needs the following supporting libraries:

 * nltk (v2.0): http://nltk.github.com/install.html
 * pygraph (v1.8.2): http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/
 * tweepy (v2.1): http://code.google.com/p/tweepy/

Installation:

1. Make sure you have installed the above libraries first. Assuming you have easy_install and pip already installed:

    $ sudo pip install -U pyyaml nltk
    $ sudo easy_install python-graph-core
    $ sudo pip install tweepy

2. Download the code & data for WhensMyBus (this contains code for all three bots) from Github:

    $ git clone git://github.com/qwghlm/WhensMyBus.git
    $ cd WhensMyBus

All the geodata is there, you do however need to set up Twitter account and access keys separately

3. Create a Twitter account for your application

4. Log into https://dev.twitter.com/ with this account, and then click My Applications

5. Create a new Application. Fill in the details, you don't need to fill in a Callback URL

6. Once your App is set up, create an access token for your own account

8. Edit the whensmytransport.cfg.sample, go the relevant section ([whensmybus], [whensmytube], [whensmydlr]). Fill in the Twitter username, consumer key & secret, user key & secret, plus the Yahoo app id (optional, see above) and save as whensmytransport.cfg

9. You can also change the debug_level to DEBUG (more messages) and test_mode to True (it will read
Tweets, but not Tweet back at the users who made them)

10. You now have a working bot! To test it, try the following test:

    $ python run_tests.py WhensMyBus --remote-apis
    $ python run_tests.py WhensMyTube --remote-apis
    $ python run_tests.py WhensMyDLR --remote-apis

  All tests should clear if a geocoder is installed and Twitter OAuth is correctly set up; if you don't care about these, try running without the --remote-apis flags

11. To get started, on the command line run any or all of the following:

    $ ./whensmybus.py
    $ ./whensmytrain.py whensmytube
    $ ./whensmytrain.py whensmydlr

Notes:

* If you ever want to update the CSV file(s) in sourcedata/ and update the database, follow the instructions for import_bus_csv_to_db() in datatools.py
* If you ever want to add the app to more Twitter accounts, follow the instructions for make_oauth_key() in lib/twitter_client.py
* Although only the Yahoo geocoder is used, there is code for Google and Bing's as well in lib/geo.py
